- Possibly put parser boilerplate in own function
  and allow for parsing a config file vs
  input arguments

-  Need to figure out setup for pip version
   of ansible to be OS agnostic

- (RHEV) fix base template to prevent adding wrong
  network interface

- Need better implementation for running playbook.
  check ansible api for possible solution

- need better fix than time.sleep() for waiting for
  server reboot
