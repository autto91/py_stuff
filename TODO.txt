- Possibly put parser boilerplate in own function
  and allow for parsing a config file vs
  input arguments (Done)

- Need to improve argument parser
    ex. use --static-ip=10.0.0.1 vs just 10.0.0.1

- Need to figure out setup for pip version
  of ansible to be OS agnostic

- (RHEV) fix base template to prevent adding wrong
  network interface

- Need better implementation for running playbook.
  check ansible api for possible solution

- need better fix than time.sleep() for waiting for
  server reboot
